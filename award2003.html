<P><A NAME="2"></A><B>2.</B> Open problem:  Does a single
axiom (e.g. Sheffer-stroke) exist for
<A HREF="qlegif/mmql.html#weak">weakly
orthomodular lattices (WOML)</A>?

<P>
What I mean is a single identity added to the usual axioms and rules of
inference for identity (reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity,
substitution).  In other words, it would be a single identity which,
together with these axioms, would determine the equational variety WOML
of weakly orthomodular lattices.

<P>It would be exactly analogous to McCune's
<A HREF="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/papers/olsax/oml-sax.html">Single
Axiom for Orthomodular
Lattices</A>  with
"WOML" substituted for "OML".  It was this page, in fact, that led me to
wonder about an analogous equation for WOML.


<!-- Related question:  will one side
of this single axiom evaluate to 1?  (I haven't been able to find
a WOML-law equivalent without this property, so if that is not the
case that would be interesting to me.)

<P><I>Update 12-Apr-2005:  Raph Levien proved that ax-9 is independent
from the others; see <A

<P><I>Update 21-Jan-2006: Juha Arpiainen proved that ax-11 is independent
from the others; see <A
HREF="#9a">item 9a</A> below.</I> Now we only have 11 more
(out of 13) independence proofs to go!

<P><B><A NAME="9a"></A>9a.</B> The open problem stated in Remark 9.5 on
p. 16 (PDF p. 17) of <A HREF="downloads/finiteaxiom.pdf">"A Finitely
Axiomatized Formalization of Predicate Calculus with Equality"</A> is
still open (as of 10-Aug-2003).  In terms of <A
HREF="mpeuni/mmset.html#pcaxioms">Metamath's axiom system</A>, the
problem asks whether <A HREF="mpeuni/ax-11.html">ax-11</A> can be proved
from ax-1 through ax-10, ax-12 through ax-15, ax-mp, and ax-gen, and no
others.  It should be noted ax-11 is not <I>logically</I> independent,
because any <I>specific</I> instance of ax-11, where phi is replaced
with a subformula containing only set (meta)variables but no wff
(meta)variables, is provable from the others mentioned.

<P><I>Update 21-Jan-2006: Juha Arpiainen <B>solved</B> this problem and proved
that ax-11 is metalogically independent from the others.  Hence,
there cannot exist a proof of ax-11 from the others.  Here is his
seven-line proof:</I>

<P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5
BGCOLOR="#F0F0F0"><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT>
<PRE>
  Ax-11 need not hold if there are additional predicates that do not
  satisfy the analogues of ax-13 and ax-14. For example, consider the
  system with one additional binary predicate "x ~ y". The set of ordered
  pairs of integers is then a model of ax-1 to ax-10, ax-12 to ax-17 if
  "x = y" and "x e. y" are interpreted as "the first components of x and y
  are equal" and "x ~ y" as "the second components are equal". However,
  equs5 (and therefore also ax-11) is false for the wff "x ~ y".</PRE>

<P><B><A NAME="9b"></A>9b.</B> An open problem is whether <A
HREF="mpeuni/ax-11o.html">ax-11o</A> can be derived in a predicate
calculus system that omits <A HREF="mpeuni/ax-16.html">ax-16</A> and <A

HREF="mpeuni/ax-11.html">ax-11</A>).  See the 5th table entry in <A

HREF="mpeuni/mmdeduction.html#proof">weak
deduction theorem</A> for classical propositional calculus.  <A
HREF="mpeuni/mmdeduction.html#quick">Example</A>
of its use.  Open problem:  In quantum propositional calculus, the
standard deduction theorem fails (and so does this weak deduction
theorem).  What kind of "weak" deduction theorems are possible?

<P><A NAME="11"></A><B>11.</B> <A HREF="mpeuni/mmcomplex.html">Axiomatization
for complex numbers</A>.  Open problem:  are the
axioms independent?  (N. Megill reduced the number from 28 to 27
on 19-Feb-2005.  Eric Schmidt weakened "1 is real" to "1 is complex"
on 11-Apr-2007.  Eric Schmidt reduced the number of axioms from 27
to 25 on 21-May-2007.)

<P><A NAME="12"></A><B>12.</B> Consider the "pure" fragment of Metamath
axiom system, <A HREF="mpeuni/mmset.html#pcaxioms">ax-1 through ax-7
(and ax-mp, ax-gen)</A>.  Open problem:  Can this fragment directly
prove all such theorem schemes of its kind*, i.e. is it complete for
this fragment?  (I think so.)  [* No predicate connectives (such as =),
no distinct variable restrictions.] Possible clue (suggested by Bob
Meyer):  this fragment seems analogous to modal logic S5 (or monadic
predicate calculus), extended by introducing the second variable y in
ax-7.

<P><A NAME="13"></A><B>13.</B>  Set theory can be added to standard first order logic
<I>without</I> equality by making the membership epsilon the only
primitive predicate and introducing equality as a defined symbol.  The
usual axioms of equality then become theorems of set theory (see
comments under the <A HREF="mpeuni/ax-ext.html">Axiom of
Extensionality</A>).  This provides a system that is quite beautiful
from a minimalist point of view.  However, in Metamath's axiom system <A
HREF="mpeuni/mmset.html#pcaxioms">predicate calculus</A> there is no
primitive notion of proper substitution, and additional equality axioms
serve this role (see the definition of <A
HREF="mpeuni/df-sb.html">proper substitution</A> and related theorems).
So dispensing with equality would almost certainly require some
additional axioms with epsilon, beyond Extensionality, to fill the gap.
Problem:  What would a "nice" set of epsilon-only axioms look like?
(The existing axioms could be expanded with the definition of equality,
of course, but they would be long and ugly with possible redundancies.)
Philosophical problem:  Would these additional axioms be part of set
theory or logic?  If they are considered part of logic, in what ways
does such a "minimal" predicate calculus, with a single arbitrary binary
predicate calculus, differ from standard predicate calculus?  How much
of proper substitution is "pushed" into set theory, and what is the
character of the non-set-theory part left over?

<P><A NAME="14"></A><B>14.</B>  In this odd formalization of <A
HREF="mpeuni/mmzfcnd.html">set theory axioms with
no distinct variable restrictions</A>, is the "Axiom of Twoness" essential
for completeness?  (I think so.)

<P><I>Update 11-Apr-2018: Beno&icirc;t Jubin proved this is the case.</I>
His proof is as follows:

<P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5
BGCOLOR="#F0F0F0"><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT>
<PRE>
  In a model with a single element which does not contain itself, all
  axioms and rules of predicate calculus, all axioms of "ZCF-no$d"
  except twoness, and all axioms of standard ZFC except ax-pow and
  ax-inf are satisifed.  In other words, strip out all quantifiers,
  evaluate all "X = Y" to True and all "X \in Y" to False.  Then, all
  axioms evaluate to True except ax-pow and ax-inf.

  Interestingly, the model with a single element containing itself
  satisfies all axioms except, of course, ax-reg (and ax-reg-no$d).
  What is interesting is that it satisfies ax-inf (and ax-inf-no$d), but
  of course it does not satisfy the real infinity axiom ax-inf2.  This
  proves that ax-reg is necessary in the derivation of
  ax-inf2.</PRE></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER>

<A HREF="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/~mccune/award-2003/megill.pdf">
Orthomodular Lattices and Beyond</A>)
[whose solution will earn a $100 prize (slide 23)]:
<OL>
<LI>As a "sanity check" it might be useful to show Otter can prove OI3
from OA3+OML.  The proof is relatively simple (for Otter too, I think)
and is shown in Th. 4.10, p. 26, of
<A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/0009038">
http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/0009038</A>.

<LI> It might be interesting to see which of the known implications on
slide 26 of
<A HREF="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/~mccune/award-2003/megill.pdf">
http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/~mccune/award-2003/megill.pdf</A>
that Otter is
able to do.  Some are easy, but others seemed tricky (to do by
hand anyway).  I can provide the proofs of any of them if desired.

<LI> I would be interested in seeing a proof of (or counterexample to) any
of the open implication directions on slide 26, such as 48+OML => 47 or
45+OML => 49.  (If a counterexample is found, that would of course also
disprove the OI3 conjecture and be eligible for the prize.)

<LI> I would also be interested in any <I>combinations</I> of equations in
slide 26 that together might produce others, in directions that are
currently unknown.  For example, can OML+46+49+53 prove 44?

<LI> The equations in slide 26 that aren't known OA3 equivalents are 45,
46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, and 53.  It would be interesting to see if any
equations in this set, or even all of them together, could (when added
to OML) prove the equation of slide 24.  (The equation of slide 24
<I>can</I> be derived from OA3+OML.)  It would not solve the OI3 conjecture
but might provide further clues.

be proved without using <A
HREF="mpeuni/ax-9.html">ax-9</A>?  This can be expressed
equivalently as the following problem in the Metamath language:

<P><CENTER><TABLE CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5
BGCOLOR="#F0F0F0"><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT> <PRE> ${
    exeqid.1 $e |- E. x x = x $.
    $( Open problem 16 in award2003.html $)
    exeqid $p |- E. y y = y $=
      ? $.
 $}</PRE></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER>

<P><I>Update 12-Apr-2005:  Raph Levien proved this is impossible.</I>
His proof is as follows:

<P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5
BGCOLOR="#F0F0F0"><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT>
<PRE>
  Assume that we have a proof of E. y y = y starting from the hypothesis
  E. x x = x. Expand out the proof so that all proof steps are
  invocations of axioms 1-8, 10-12, 16-17, mp and gen, and all
  metavariables are replaced by actual variables, including x_4 as the
  replacement for y.

  Now transform all proof steps so that any equality involving x_4
  becomes "false", and check whether the resulting proof still holds.
  All of the axioms not involving equality should be ok. ax-8 is ok
  because in all cases where the consequent becomes false, at least one
  of the antecedents also becomes false. ax-10 is ok because if either x
  or y is x_4, then the antecedent is false. ax-11 is ok because the
  second antecedent is false. ax-12 is trickier, but goes like this: if
  z is distinct from x and y, then the consequent follows from ax-17
  even if z is x_4. If x or y is x_4, then the third antecedent is
  false. Lastly, ax-16 is ok because if x or y is x_4, then A. x x = y
  becomes false.

  Thus, all transformed proof steps are true when interpreted in
  standard axioms. However, the transformed E. x_4 x_4 = x_4 is false,
  which is a contradiction.</PRE></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER>

<P>If you find the "meaning" of x_4 as a bound variable in Raph's proof
is troublesome, notice that all of the axioms and rules of logic (other
than ax-9 itself) hold if you simply strip out the quantifiers.  So with
quantifiers stripped out, a purported proof would prove x_4 = x_4 from
x_3 = x_3.  Then, using a model where x_4 does not equal anything,
Raph's contradiction follows.

<P>This also shows (as obvious corollaries) that ax-9 is independent
from the others, and also that we need ax-9 to prove x = x.


<P><A NAME="17"></A><B>17.</B> (Predicate calculus with equality) In <A
HREF="mpeuni/mmset.html#tradopn">Appendix 3:  Traditional Textbook
Axioms of Predicate Calculus with Equality</A>, last paragraph, an open
problem is whether any or all of axioms <A
HREF="mpeuni/mmset.html#pcaxioms">ax-4 through ax-17</A> can be proved
(directly in Metamath) from the "traditional axioms" expressed as
theorems <A HREF="mpeuni/mmset.html#traditional">stdpc4, stdpc5, ax-gen,
stdpc6, and stdpc7</A>, using <A HREF="mpeuni/dfsb7.html">dfsb7</A> as the
definition for proper substitution.  (The reason to choose dfsb7 over <A
HREF="mpeuni/df-sb.html">df-sb</A> is to be as conventional as
possible.)  This is interesting because the traditional axioms provide a
<I>logically</I> complete system of predicate calculus that is familiar
to more people.  We could separate the axioms for predicate calculus and
equality into two groups, the traditional logically complete set and a
supplemental "technical" set consisting of that subset of ax-4 through
ax-17 (or some variant of them) needed to achieve <I>metalogical</I>
completeness.
