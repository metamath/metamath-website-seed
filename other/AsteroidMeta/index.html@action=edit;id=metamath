=What is Metamath?=
Quoting from the project's [http://us.metamath.org/index.html homepage],

: Metamath is a tiny language that can express theorems in abstract mathematics,
accompanied by proofs that can be verified by a computer program.

Another quote:

: What really makes Norman Megill (the creator) such a great guy is the fact
that you can download the GPL'd source for the software used to build and verify
the proofs in the Metamath language.  Also available are a complete tarball of
the entire site and a GFDL'd book about meta-mathematics and the Metamath
software (with &lt;nowiki&gt;TeX&lt;/nowiki&gt; source).

Indeed, most of the actual (meta)mathematics on this site has been released to
the public domain.  See Norman Megill's interesting essay on copyright in
mathematics included in the [http://us.metamath.org/copyright.html metamath
copyright terms] page (and compare the [http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/qed/qed.html QED manifesto], also cited in Norm's essay).

== Elsewhere ==

There is a &quot;Metamath book&quot;, entitled &quot;Metamath: A Computer Language for Pure Mathematics&quot;  available as a PDF download
(http://us.metamath.org/downloads/metamath.pdf) or as a printed-on-demand
paperback book (http://www.lulu.com/content/124435, 207 pages for around 11 dollars).

However, I am not finding the ''!LaTeX sources'' for this book
anywhere on the web, nor does the PDF version include a copy of the
FDL (although it says it is ''released under'' the FDL).  Maybe I'm just
not looking in the right place for the sources.  A copy of the license
should be included in published versions of the book, and it would be good
to include links to the machine-readable source (see the FDL for exact details). 

--[[jcorneli]]

Oops, the !LaTeX source link got deleted during a recent home page revision.
It is restored here: http://us2.metamath.org:8888/index.html#book
and a direct link is: http://us.metamath.org/latex/metamath.tex.
The comment at the beginning explains how to compile it.

As for the license details, I am not an expert on such matters and
just followed the instructions of someone some years ago.  Is not a link to 
the license adequate?  If not, where should the license go?  Is there an
example I can look at? --[[norm]] 21-Oct-05

A link is not adequate, as it says in the FDL:

 ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

 To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
 the License in the document and put the following copyright and
 license notices just after the title page:

 Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
 Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
 under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
 with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
 A copy of the license is included in the section entitled &quot;GNU
 Free Documentation License&quot;.

Furthermore, it says

: If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.

Thus, you should be including the above-mentioned link to metamath.tex
somewhere in PDF and print versions of the document, probably as part
of section entitled &quot;History&quot;.

That should be sufficient.  book.pdf in http://www-texdev.ics.mq.edu.au/FEM/ 
gets at least some of these things right.  Hopefully I've made the
issues clear by quoting the relevant portions of the FDL, however.
--[[jcorneli]] 23 Oct 05

It does seem that strictly speaking, the license must be included in the
work and not simply referenced indirectly by reference.  Using the
!LaTeX version they provide, it adds 10 pages to the book!  The cost of
the book will increase accordingly, and it seems like a waste of trees.
For a 2- or 3-page manual, say for a small program, to turn into a 12-
or 13-page manual seems a little absurd.

I'm a little unhappy with this aspect of the license, and I really
don't want to add 10 pages of legalese to my book.  Right now I am
considering just making the whole thing public domain for simplicity.
Other than possible plagiarism, which seems unlikely and in any case
rather easy to expose, I don't see a clear benefit of the FDL for
a book like this.

One thing I wonder about is that some of the &quot;fair use&quot; quotations are
not yet in the public domain, so if I declare the book public domain,
does that misrepresent the &quot;fair use&quot; quotations that, strictly
speaking, may still be under copyright?
--[[norm]] 24-Jul-2006

I'd support that choice.  

In response to your question, to sum up, I don't think that's a problem.

And in a bit more detail: when you put something in the public domain,
what you are doing is waiving the special status had under copyright.  You can't
waive rights that you don't have.  If, hypothetically speaking, those quotes were a copyright
infringement, then there can be downstream copyright infringments once the document is
transfered to public domain (this is one of the reasons that one should be &quot;careful&quot;
to make sure that things that advertise themselves as being public domain actually are).  
However, since you say that you are in fact making fair
use of the quotations, people who use the document under public domain terms
aren't committing any crime.  --[[jcorneli]]



=General Discussion=

==Ghilbert?==

I have begun a comparative analysis of Ghilbert in relation to Metamath. Ghilbert contains some interesting ideas. The Python code to verify a Ghilbert proof doesn't appear to be a problem (don't need it), and the files referenced at ghilbert.org contain a Metamath copyright from 2003 -- but since then Norman Megill has put set.mm into the public domain via a &quot;Creative Commons&quot; license (no, public domain is technically not a &quot;license&quot;; one places works into the public domain with a declaration -- [[raph]]), and the rest of Metamath is GPL'd. So is the IP status of the Ghilbert design the issue here? The design document states, &quot;Ghilbert can largely be considered to be a patch on Metamath to improve those weaknesses.&quot; So where is the beef? Ghilbert patents? Does someone want to contact Raph Levien and find out -- because for sure if he wants Ghilbert to become a planetary standard he will want people to use his file specifications. --[[ocat]]

My intent is for Ghilbert to be very, very free, and sorry for not making that clearer. I haven't done a careful release just out of laziness, but when I do it will definitely be either GPL or less restrictive. The set.mm database that I've converted to Ghilbert syntax should have the same copyright as the original, which as ocat points out above is none at all. As it happens, over the last year or so I've done a ton of work on Ghilbert that I have not yet released, including a nearly complete interpretation of HOL logic in ZFC set theory, and a development of predicate calculus that's more decoupled from set theory than Norm's version in set.mm (for example, his definition of substitution uses set abstraction). In any case, I'm more than willing to discuss Ghilbert, its design, and so on, but am a little unsure about the netiquette. I don't want to just barge in here and create a ton of pages; perhaps it would be more appropriate to do the gardening of [http://ghilbert.org/ ghilbert.org] and put some more
detailed writing there.--[[raph]]


==Metamath and logic agnosticism==

One question for the metamathematically minded people investigating this
software package is: how does metamath &quot;do&quot; logic agnosticism?  Can you explain
this to the rest of us in concrete terms (I know, it is asking a lot to be
concrete about metamathematics!)  Are there examples in alternate logics?
Does anyone care to try to do some math in weird logics (e.g. using category
theory instead of set theory as the basis of mathematical reality)?
Don't get too overwhelmed (or too overwhelming), but it would be interesting
to see something about these topics. --[[jcorneli]] Sun Jun 19 01:28:40 2005 UTC

Tenative Answer: Metamath has no built-in logic or definition of &quot;truth&quot;. A
valid proof is simply a reverse polish notation sequence of statement labels
that when fed into the Proof Verification engine exactly recreates the formula
being proved. The Proof engine itself may be termed a stack-based
automaton. The difference between a Proof and the RPN version of a formula's
parse tree is that the parse tree's RPN can refer only to syntax axioms and
variable hypotheses, while a proof can, in addition, refer to any previously
defined logical hypothesis or assertion. &quot;Proving&quot; is simply the work involved
in substituting expressions for variables -- and ensuring that only valid
substitutions are performed (there is much to be said about &quot;Type Codes&quot;, which
are implicit in Metmath but don't get a whole lot of airtime in Metamath.pdf.)

Metamath includes a rather large Quantum Logic database (ql.mm), as well as a
very instructive work by Bob Solovay, peano.mm. In addition, set.mm's axioms are
defined throughout the file, as needed, so it is possible to see how far one can
get using the &quot;Intuitionist&quot; approach--[[ocat]]

Cool, thanks for the answer.  Ray put together some [[template utilities]] that
seem similar on a mechanical level, and has just recently been talking in more
theoretical terms about &quot;[[Terms, Definitions, and Systems of Axioms]]&quot; (the
ideas there again seem similar, on a theory level). --[[jcorneli]] Sun Aug 07 01:01:40 2005 UTC

I created a page showing several Grammars recently extracted from key Metamath databases: [[metamath-Grammars]] Perhaps the information will be interesting? I know set.mm rocked my world when I tried my hand at writing a &quot;naive&quot; parser, and the Bottom Up algorithm will not complete set.mm before next Friday (but Earley Parser works fine, about 8 seconds for building the grammar, validating and parsing.) The problem isn't the size of the database but the complexity of some of the statements (very!) I think the job of OCR'ing arbitrary math texts will definitely entail handling Notations that are challenging, and their Grammars will perhaps be very challenging as well. [[ocat]] Sun Aug 07 01:22:22 2005 EDT

([[norm]] here) In addition to the examples mentioned by [[ocat]], the
Metamath Solitaire applet demonstrates implicational logic, intuitionist
propositional calculus, modal logic, modal provability logic, Euclidean
geometry, and weak D-complete logic.  The applet's axioms can be used as
the starting points for Metamath theorem databases in these logics for
anyone interested in them.

Category theory can be done in Metamath by extending the ZFC axioms
with the Grothendieck axiom (Metamath book, p. xii).

As for other &quot;weird logics,&quot; one interesting example I'd like to
investigate some day is quantum set theory, proposed by Takeuti.  It has
the strange property that quantum-set equality is non-Leibnizian, i.e. x
= y does not necessarily imply x \in z iff y \in z for all z.

Most &quot;weird logics&quot; such as intuitionistic, relevance, quantum logic,
etc. are weak fragments of classical logic, i.e. all of their theorems
hold in classical logic.  A very interesting exception is the family of
paraconsistent logics.  For example, one such system has an axiom called
&quot;relativity&quot;, ((A -&gt; B) -&gt; B) -&gt; A, which does not hold in classical
logic!

I agree that Metamath is &quot;logically agnostic&quot;; that is an interesting
way to describe it that I haven't heard before.
Specifically, it can implement all the above logics natively, since
you tell it what the axioms are, starting from an empty framework that
is devoid of any logic at all.  Most other proof languages presuppose
a fixed built-in logic that is usually classical.  This is not to say
that they can't work with the above logics, just that they must deal
with them as external mathematical objects rather than doing their
proofs directly in the logics themselves.  -- [[norm]] 6 Sep 2005

Agnostic -- noncommittal -- *is* a better description than &quot;catholic&quot; -- broad or liberal scope.

=Metamath content=

I'm interested in using metamath to explore propositional and predicate calculus using a natural deduction
based system of axioms. I wonder if this wiki is a place where some questions about this subject could be 
asked. In my mind it would be a sort of commentary to the set.mm which is a liitle bit &quot;too dry&quot; for mere beginners like me (since there are only the theorems and very few commentaries). Questions would look like 
this : &quot;how the substitution definition has been coined ?  What was the (potential) intellectual process of its creator when he/she invented the definition. I think it can be helpful to grasp a definition that is not as straightforward as the usual one ? &quot;

But perhaps this wiki is only about the metamath program in itself (and other connected programs) and not
about the content of the set.mm file ?

--[[frl]]

Hello *frl*! Bienvenue. I hope you will provide a copy of your
.mm files. Are you planning to use textbooks as the basis for
your experiments with Metamath, or do you plan to create your
own language from scratch? I look forward to hearing about your
experiments. --[[ocat]]

Hi ocat, merci de m'accueillir. If you need it I will give the .mm file but I still need to polish it up. To realize the .mm file I mainly used a text by Christoph Benzmüller called &quot;from natural deduction to sequent calculus (and back)&quot;. And obviously I learned a lot by studying the proofs in set.mm. Eventually I asked some questions to norm who helped me a lot.


Here is a link to Benzmüller's text :

http://www.ags.uni-sb.de/~chris/papers/2002-pisa.pdf

-- [[frl]] 27-Sep-05

Hi *frl*, that is very exciting information. I first heard about
Sequent Calculus a few days ago at:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequent_calculus

Excerpt: &quot;... sequent calculi and the general concepts relating to them are of major importance to the whole field of proof theory and mathematical logic... &quot; 

and from:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_theory

we obtain the list of primary suspects in the investigation!

&quot;Together with model theory, axiomatic set theory, and recursion theory, proof theory is one of the so-called four pillars of the foundations of mathematics.&quot;

So, Mr. Holmes (frl), I await your final .mm results with
great anticipation -- Dr. Watson ( --[[ocat]] 27-Sep-2005 )

=More Discussion=

Thanks for posting folks.  Feel free to use the wiki to talk about your
projects as much as it is helpful to you -- I think it would be great
if [[AM]] could be the wiki center for metamath &amp; its clan.

Raph, on Ghilbert, I assumed that you did want to make a FAIF release &amp;
simply hadn't had time yet.  I'm glad that this is the case &amp; look forward
to news of the release of the legally sanctified version.  Again,
if the wiki seems to be a good medium for you and your audience/contributors,
go ahead and use it as much as you like.  I'll certainly have some questions as
time goes by.

--[[jcorneli]]

Ocat, on your metamath vs ghilbert notes: I wonder if you'd be
interested in writing a metamath vs mizar note.  Of course, it would
have a different flavor.  Or maybe there is something on Norm's site
that already says the things most people would be interested in
knowing about the relationship (and differences) between these
programs. 

--[[jcorneli]]

jcorneli: ghilbert *is* metamath plus definitions plus interfaces plus
sexps minus notation -- and with a great improvement in the proof
algorithm (AFAIK - a proof of the ghilbert proof algorithm is needed.)
my only qualification for saying anything about metamath or ghilbert
is that i paid expensive tuition by writing code expressing the
Metamath.pdf specifications. i'm just a code monkey, in other
words. --[[ocat]]

Well, I think someone should write such a thing at some point.  Had
I written a master's thesis, one of the possible topics might have
been &quot;a comparison of several provers.&quot;  [http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/ Freek]
has written [http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/comparison/index.html a comparison] 
(of sorts), but it lacks narration.  Incidentally, since Freek's comparison
is sort of a rosetta stone of provers (by way of the irrationality of the
square root of two), someone might want to write a proof of this lemma in
hcode, and presumably a ghilbert proof could be added to the list very
soon.

{this looks better than the raw source file at Freek's page:
http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/sqr2irr.html ) --[[ocat]]

The overall goal of comparing and understanding the various provers
is huge.  Ocat, I'm sure that if you felt like it, you could use your
expert knowledge of one system to learn another one somewhat more
easily than an average new user, who'd be learning cold.  But it isn't
imperative that you write such a thing, it was just a passing thought
I had. --[[jcorneli]]

Great. I was also going to post a link to Freek's paper. Since I have looked
at Mizar in some detail, and HOL in more, I hope you'll find some
[[Notes on Various Proof Systems]] helpful. -- [[raph]]

Thanks Raph!  Seems very helpful, written at a nice level, and with a
good set of hyperlinks to other material.  This should be expanded
upon as time goes by, but its a very swell beginning.  As for the
goals of HDM vis a vis formal systems (or maybe &quot;objectives&quot; would be
a better word), that may be somewhat in flux.

Figuring out how
things will be proved and processed is a big task, and right now I'm
dealing with finishing up a presentable demo of
[[scholium system|something else]] that HDM needs.  Ray has been
focusing on more formal things, but of late his availability has
been somewhat limited (and may continue to be).

But to come to the point: I think the objectives are (1) to
assemble the tools (hopefully from existing pieces when possible) to do basic
proof checking and theorem proving, and make them work with a general-purpose
high-level mathematical [[hcode|language]]; (2) ''If'' we can
figure out a way to do it legally, which in many cases we probably
can't, it may be possible to use existing work in computer math
by translating their code into a format we can use.  However,
(2) is only going to work when the corpus's rights are either public
domain or (more generally) GNU GPL compatible.  And of course there is the actual work involved to be considered (could be quite non-trivial).

Given the somewhat limited mindpower behind this problem at present,
you're welcome to jump in and suggest and/or define some new objectives.
Ray may be able to say more about specific immediate goals and also
about his current work in this area.  I'm mainly just in &quot;learning background material&quot; mode right now.

[([[norm]]:)Good-but-not-''that''-]big news today at the Metamath headquarters! 

http://us2.metamath.org:8888/mpegif/mmnotes.txt

(21-Oct-05) A big change (involving about 121 theorems) was put into the
database today:  the indexed union (ciun, df-iun) and indexed
intersection symbols (ciin, df-iin) are now underlined to distinguish
them from ordinary union (cuni, df-uni) and intersection (cint, df-int).
Although the old syntax was unambiguous, it did not allow for LALR
parsing of the syntax constructions in set.mm, and the proof that it was
unambiguous was tricky.  The new syntax moves us closer to LALR
parsability.  Hopefully it improves readability somewhat as well by
using a distinguished symbol.  Thanks to Peter Backes for suggesting
this change.

Originally I considered &quot;...&quot; under the symbol to vaguely suggest
&quot;something goes here,&quot; i.e. the index range in the 2-dimensional
notation, but in the end I picked the underline for its simplicity (and
Peter prefered it over the dots).  Of course I am open to suggestion and
can still change it.  In the distant future, there may be a
2-dimensional typesetting to display Metamath notation (probably
programmed by someone other than me), but for now it is an interesting
challenge to figure out the &quot;most readable&quot; 1-dimensional representation
of textbook notation, where the symbol string maps 1-1 to the ASCII
database symbols.

iuniin is the same as before but has an expanded comment, and also
illustrates the new notation.

(18-Oct-05) Today we show a shorter proof of the venerable theorem id.
Compare the previous version at http://de2.metamath.org/mpegif/id.html .

-----

I threw in the new &quot;id&quot; proof announcement because that theorem
has been looked at more than any other one, AFAIK. The proof
is now down to 3 steps :)

About LALR, I have been informed that instead of creating a parser
that can handle ambiguous grammars, the difficulty of proving
un-ambiguity (impossible in the general case), means that that is
just living with the problem instead of fixing it. The preferred
approach is to *make* the grammar fit LALR(k) for some k, thus
&quot;proving&quot; the grammar to be unambiguous. And if that is done, then
standard tools can generate a parser, which is an added benefit.
I think this is relevant for HDM as well, especially since 
an industrial strength parser is not really that fun a thing to
write from scratch.

--[[ocat]] 21-Oct-2005

It appears I mispoke when I said &quot;The new syntax allows LALR
parsing,&quot; so I changed it to &quot;The new syntax moves us closer to LALR
parsability&quot; above.  From Peter Backes:

:  It makes it more LALR than before, but not completely. ;)
  
:  What remains is
:  
:    1) set = set (trivial, since redundant)      
[i.e. [http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/weq.html weq] vs. 
[http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/wceq.html wceq]]
:    2) set e. set (trivial, since redundant)     
[i.e. [http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/wel.html wel] vs. 
[http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/wcel.html wcel]]
:    3) [ set / set ] (trivial, since redundant)  
[i.e. [http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/wsb.html wsb] vs. 
[http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/wsbc.html wsbc]]
:    4) { &lt;. set , set &gt;. | wff } (we already discussed it and agreed it
    was not easy to solve)                       
[i.e. [http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/copab.html copab]]
:    5) { &lt;. &lt;. set , set &gt;. , set &gt;. | wff } (ditto)   
[i.e. [http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/weq.html copab2]]

These are all easy to fix by brute force (eliminating weq, wel, and wsb,
and changing &quot;{&quot;, &quot;}&quot; to &quot;{.&quot;, &quot;}.&quot; in copab and copab2), but I am looking into
whether there are &quot;nicer&quot; ways to do this first as I plod along slowly
but carefully.  It will get there eventually. :) 
On the off-chance anyone actually ''needs'' a true LALR set.mm,
let me know and I can quickly prepare a custom version with
these brute-force changes.  It should be noted that if (4) and (5)
are left alone, and only (1)-(3) fixed, we would 
have a LALR[7] version of set.mm, but LALR[7] cannot be handled
by bison/yacc. --[[norm]] 21-Oct-2005

Related to ql.mm at www.metamath.org, I came across this today at BoingBoing.net: [http://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge173.html David Deutsch, founder of the field of quantum computation, named recipient of the 2005 $100,000 Edge of Computation Science Prize]

Areas of related interest also mentioned:

&quot;Also in 2000, in &quot;Machines, Logic and Quantum Physics&quot; (with A. Ekert and R. Lupacchini), a philosophic paper, not a scientific one, he appealed to the existence of a distinctive quantum theory of computation to argue that our knowledge of mathematics is derived from, and is subordinate to, our knowledge of physics (even though mathematical truth is independent of physics).

In 2002, he answered several long-standing questions about the multiverse interpretation of quantum theory in &quot;The Structure of the Multiverse&quot; -- in particular, what sort of structure a 'universe' is, within the multiverse. It does this by using the methods of the quantum theory of computation to analyse information flow in the multiverse.&quot;

Wow. --[[ocat]] 14-Nov-2005

As a curious coincidence I am reading Deutch's original paper right now.

First, I would like to thank Planet Math and Asteroid Meta for hosting mmj2 and the Metamath+Friends discussion area. The kindness is appreciated greatly. And I would like to thank Norm Megill for inventing Metamath, thereby providing a source of endless amusement and educational benefits for people all over the world! 

Secondly, Merry Holidays to everyone! I am very sure that everyone here will be receiving presents from Santa instead of coal :) (Or not.)

Finally, I have an idea for the possible benefit of HDM when it
reaches the stage of being able to Borg up all available mathelogical
content. I am unsure of the popularity of this idea, but I will run it
up the flagpole anyway to see who salutes... If the Friends of
Metamath -- Ghilbert, Bourbaki, Hmm, (and future friends) -- can
provide a utility to convert to and from Metamath &quot;.mm&quot; format, then
all HDM needs is a similar utility in order to be able to hoover up
all content from Metamath and these other systems! Later, HDM can
presumably write conversions for Earth's other great math systems and
snarfle up their content -- as permitted by law and consent of the
owners. In theory HDM should be able to convert Metamath .mm
statements to HCode, if that is on the final agenda, so eventually
everything will come together without a lot of extra work (except for
ontological reconciliation, but we knew that already :)

: Good point; regard .mm as a &quot;metalanguage&quot; for the FOM programs.
Seems reasonable to (non-expert) me.  Similarly, hcode is supposed to
be a metalanguage for many and various mathematical languages. --[[jcorneli]]

: Perhaps &quot;metalanguage&quot; does not convey the intent of my idea
accurately. Bourbaki and Ghilbert provide additional language
capabilities. A conversion to Metamath wouldn't necessarily preserve
100% of information in every file/database in these languages --
that would depend on the content. So Metamath could be considered
a lowest common denominator, a base. The beauty of having a common
&quot;base&quot; language and converters to/from these other languages is
portability amongst themselves, as well as the obvious benefit
to HDM of having, potentially one day, tens of thousands of
proven, consistent theorems in various axiom systems starting 
from the bare metal of logic. Then when you have a &quot;standard&quot;,
mainline HDM ontology, it should be possible to reconcile 
everything, assimilate it all, including the FEM entries,
and detect duplicates, congruencies, etc. --[[ocat]]

Ghilbert's design was driven in very large part by the desire to allow smooth translations to and from other systems. In theory, it can translate seamlessly to and from Metamath (it just needs some more code to do this in practice). I think there are some other advantages to the Ghilbert approach, including much simpler handling of syntax. --[[raph]]

== hierarchy of systems ==
Let's suppose I have a sound system of axioms. Let's suppose I derive theorems from this system. Now if I replace one of my axioms by one of the theorems I derived I think my system is still sound. But it may be /less/ complete (if I dare say) than the previous one. Now if I use this new system to derive another set of theorems and if once again I replace one of the axioms by one of the new derived theorems I get a third system still sound and still /less/ complete than the two previous ones. If we call T1, T2, T3 the sets of theorems we can obtain in each system I think we have T3 is included in T2 and T2 is included in T1. I wonder if we can use this process to have a system where a given theorem is not provable ? [[frl]] 1-May-2006

: I don't understand the algorithm you are proposing, that would lead to making
a given theorem unprovable.  How would you use the given theorem as the &quot;input&quot; to
the algorithm? [[norm]] 2-May-2006
:: You are right it is the weak point. :-) [[frl]] 2-May-2006

== How Does Norm Create New Proofs? ==

Norm, would you describe the actual process you use to create
new Metamath proofs? Specific items of interest:
* Do you first outline a new proof on paper?

:: If a proof is very simple, like chaining together a few equalities to
achieve the result, I don't write anything down but just type it in
directly.

:: .

:: The harder the proof, the more detail I put on paper before I start.  In
the case of very difficult proofs, I work out every detail on paper
before I start.  The reason is mainly that there are often little
gotcha's that I'll overlook in my mental proof sketch, that will get
identified when I force myself to think through the details.  If I try
to enter such a proof directly, without working out the details, I will
often get stuck in a path that can't be completed, which is frustrating.

:: .

:: I may try to enter a moderately difficult proof directly, sometimes with
luck, and other times I'll see that I really need to work out the
details.  And even the details on paper can vary in detail - a rough
sketch is more efficient time-wise, but with a higher risk I'll get
stuck.  There have been proofs where I've worked out on paper 3 or 4
versions of successively increasing detail, each in response to another
gotcha I ran into.

:: .

:: For the most difficult proofs, I often work out every detail in pretty
much the same way it will be entered in Metamath.  Even though it is
tedious, it will usually actually save time and certainly much
frustration with multiple false starts.  I may do this on a plane or while
waiting for a doctor's appointment.  

:: .

:: Perhaps a
concrete example might be helpful.  Consider the theorem
[[http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/alephfp.html alephfp]], &quot;the aleph
function has a fixed point.&quot;  I found this to be a reasonably difficult
proof to do in Metamath.  I scanned the page from the notes that I wrote
down before entering the proof, which you can see here as
[[http://us2.metamath.org:8888/alephfp.png alephfp.png]] (1700 by 2200 hi-res scan). (24-Sep-2006 - the corrupted png was fixed. -[[norm]])
This proof sketch, which is about the most
detailed that I would ever do, has about half the number of steps as
the Metamath proof.  I do proof sketches this detailed only for the
most difficult proofs.  Note that lines 2-4 led down a false path, and you
can see that I crossed them out (barely visible diagonal line) when I
realized that.  The big &quot;V&quot; through the middle of the proof is a giant
checkmark I made when Metamath told me the proof was complete.  I picked
this one, by the way, because it is one of the rare cases where my notes
are semi-legible.  :)



* Do you see the proof sketch in your mind's eye before typing anything?

:: See above.


* Do you begin by asking yourself what is the &quot;qed&quot; assertion
  (i.e. working backward)?

:: Actually, when I work the proof out on paper, I usually work
forward.  Basically, I'll have smaller subgoals of
 several intermediate pieces
will be needed, and I tend to make fewer mistakes working forwards
on those.  On the other had, in order to identify the subgoals, I'll
have either worked backward from the final theorem, or they will be
proof steps in a textbook, each of which is like a little local lemma.

:: .

:: To obtain the major subgoals, I will often combine paper and 
the Metamath program, using the latter to do simple manipulations
to get it in the form I need
(rearranging antecendents, etc.), then using that as my subgoal to
work out on paper when
things start to become less obvious.

* What portions of a proof do you create using the computer? Are
  these &quot;fill-in-the-blanks&quot; steps primarily the propositional
  logic steps, with perhaps some predicate calculus identities
  thrown in?

:: If I can &quot;see&quot; in my head how to prove a little local lemma or 
subgoal that I described above, then I'll often try to enter it
(when I'm at that point in building the proof via the MM-PA CLI)
directly without writing it down.

* How do you decide that a proof is too long (and why do we see
  these 100 or 200 step proofs -- aren't there reusable components
  inside those long proofs)?

:: Recently, I've tended to impose about a 1/2 megabyte limit on the
web page size - bigger than that, and I tend to break it into lemmas.
The big proofs very rarely have reusable components - if they do, it has
probably already been broken out by a new utility theorem that was
proved separately.   Consider the really big proofs, the ones that 
may have half a dozen or more lemmas.  Even though I try to pick &quot;natural&quot;,
self-contained subproofs for the various lemmas, they are rarely reused
for anything else, and if you look at them you can see why -
they tend to be long and specialized, and it's hard to imagine a use
for them.

:: .

:: Assuming that there are no reusuable components, from a database
size perspective it is more efficient not to break a long proof into
lemmas, because there tend to be common subproofs and subwffs that
aid compression, and there is the overhead of the lemma itself.

-----
More questions if you don't mind:

In theory sub-goals could be input on the
mmj2 PA GUI's Proof Worksheet as:

    
    h1       |- blah blah hyp 1
    h2       |- blah blah hyp 2
    
        
    100:?:   |- blah blah sub-goal 1
    
    
    200:?:   |- blah blah sub-goal 2
        
    
    300:?:   |- blah blah sub-goal 3
    
    
    qed:?:   |- blah blah final goal
     

The &quot;?&quot;s prevent the derivation step from being
considered &quot;in error&quot; and thus prevent generation
of a message (though the new Unify-Get Hints is
specifically coded to output &quot;hint&quot; labels of assertions
that unify with just the formulas of these steps).

So in theory, the working out of a proof could
proceed using the mmj2 PA GUI by breaking down
the problems and completing sub-goals in any
desired order.

* But...is the process involving pencil, paper and
manual symbol manipulation a necessary ingredient
in your (human? :) proving activities?

:: Probably. When I'm &quot;thinking&quot; about how to formalize
a (nontrivial) proof, the biggest hurdle is often trying
to figure out the informal textbook proof.  Typically
I translate the sentences into what the Metamath steps
corresponding to them would look like.  These become
the subgoals.  5 sentences in a book might be 50 or 100
steps in a Metamath proof.

* Does use of ASCII shorthand symbols instead of
the semiotically hardwired math symbols interfere
with the creative process?

:: No.  Of course I picked the ASCII shorthand I liked, so this might not
be true for everyone, who are stuck with my choices.  On paper I'll
often use an intermediate local shorthand like &quot;r&quot; for &quot;rank&quot;,
or a little box to represent a group of symbols I need to
drag around but don't feel like rewriting.

* If you had a digital pad and stylus plus voice
recognition software wired with grammatical parsing,
unification searching (like mmj2 PA) and perhaps a
dialogue module, would it be possible to *not* use
pencil and paper? What if the digital pad were instead
a huge electronic whiteboard equipped with the
same software -- or VR gear with a contralto vocoder?

:: I have never been able to get used to inputting things on digital pad.
But I also haven't made a concerted effort to do so.  When PDAs were all
the rage, my &quot;PDA&quot; was a little notebook and a pencil.  I also can't &quot;think&quot; easily on
a blackboard, like many people can.  So my experience might not be
a good example.

* Is the advantage of pencil and paper that you can
scribble much faster than you can input math via
the keyboard? OR is the advantage that you can
write a formula's symbols on paper out of sequence
without inconvenience?

::  I think it is the latter, although probably little of both.  I don't like writing out or typing long,
tedious expressions.  Example:  the proof of grothprim was done entirely
on the computer, letting the computer figure out the long expressions
via unification.  But there, I knew what the steps would be, since they
are just expanding definitions.  Someone naive looking at grothprim
might think, &quot;my god, what an incredibly tedious proof&quot; when in fact it
was one of the most trivial.

:: .

:: alephfp was extreme in the other direction.  That proof was so frustrating for
me, and I went through so many false starts due to mistakes in my rough
sketches, that in the end I just brute-forced it, almost in anger, by
writing out everything in such meticulous detail that it ''couldn't''
be wrong.  And, in a funny way, writing out the details, even to the
point of copying the same subexpressions from one line to the next instead
of some shorthand like a box representing them, provided a subconcious
excuse not to have to think so hard, providing mental breaks between the
hard thinking.  And possibly writing things out in such detail may have
provided subconcious clues to the hard thinking via some kind of
osmosis, who knows.

:: .

:: Thinking back to alephfp, why didn't I just type it in (say in an
editor, forgetting about metamath for the moment)?  I'm not sure.  It
just seemed more natural to write that one (and most of my sketches) on
paper, which I could stare at and think through
while pacing, etc.  Also, the
metamath ascii wears out my thumb (space bar) as Raph has noted.  There
have been proofs that I've done the sketches for in a text editor, sometimes using an
abbreviated pidgin math (one letter per symbol, no spaces except to separate
blocks whose parens might be omitted for brevity) invented for the one-time
purpose of the problem.  The editor lets me copy and paste subexpressions
carried from step to step.  But this is usually when I already know roughly
what the proof will look like and just need a more detailed
sketch; the hard stuff is always on paper initially.


* Is it true that -- when you are &quot;in the zone&quot; --
that you are working at a sub-verbal level? That
the formulas merely express your ideas? That the
derivation steps make the lists of formulas conform
to your thoughts and what you already believe to
be true? (Granted some cases of discovery of
truths seemingly embedded in the symbols -- idiomatic
shortcuts, say.)

:: Answering your questions requires deep psychological
introspection that eludes me right now.  Perhaps I
should just say, &quot;yes&quot;.


* Is it generally the case that you work on *families*
of related proofs in an area of math/logic...over a
period of days or weeks? (Thus we can predict the
benefits of a &quot;current workspace&quot; PA'ing metaphor
involving most recently/frequently used symbols,
sub-expressions, syntax and assertions.)

:: I will tend to have a specific goal in mind, like proving every metric
space is a topology, and this will naturally lead to all kinds of little
lemmas from prop calc to the theories themselves that I discover I need
but aren't in the database yet.  The prop calc/pred calc/elementary set theory part has been
stable for a long time, with virtually everything you would encounter in
a logic/elementary set theory book and much more, and there are probably few new things I
will add over time.  Although surprises crop up occasionally.

:: .

::  But, given a goal, there are certainly specific areas in the
database where I know to look for the previous relevant results.  If I
am trying to prove an inequality involving multiplication of complex
numbers, I'm not going to be using the theory of ordinals.

:: .

:: Unlike what has been speculated, I have a poor memory for theorem
labels, except for a small handful that are used all the time
(ax-mp, bitr, eqtr, etc.).  I do have a general idea of what's in the
database and use the 'search' command with wildcards all the time
to find out their names and their specific forms.

Also:
* Is there an overnight process involved in proving
(for you) that involves subconscious problem solving?

::  First, it is rare that what I put into the database is something
that would be considered a &quot;new result&quot; in the sense that, for example,
it could lead to a peer-reviewed publication (i.e. would be considered
new and significant by mathematicians).  I am just encoding existing
knowledge.  But given that, there are many, many proofs in the
literature that are so sketchy that I have doubts that the author
actually worked out the details.  Or maybe the author did, in his/her
head, and left the details as an implicit exercise/torture for the
reader.  Nonetheless, it is suprisingly rare (although not unheard of)
that the final theorem being proved is actually wrong.  It is almost
like the mathematician is able to &quot;see&quot; that a theorem is true
before proving it, and the proof is just a nuisance to be worked out
in just enough detail to convince his/her colleagues.  Sometimes I
discover that there
are additional assumptions that the author has left unstated,
e.g. that a certain set must be nonempty for the theorem to hold.  But
in such a case, it usually is nonempty in the theorem's final
application, so I don't know whether the author knew that it had to be
nonempty for the theorem to hold and just omitted it as an irrelevant
distraction.  It can be an additional complication in formalizing the proof,
though, since I may not know what the actual theorem will look like until
the proof is worked out in detail.

:: .

:: Unlike most mathematicians, I often do not feel confident in
my own proofs with the
sparse level of detail that is typical.  This can make me
feel not as smart as them, and I am often in awe the things they are
able to prove that way yet not make a mistake.  Most computer
programmers can't do this, since their programs almost always have bugs.
(I know some computer programmers are mathematicians and vice-versa,
and there seems to be something intrinsically different about the
two activities.  But deep mathematical proofs seem to have
as many possiblities for error as a typical
computer program, if not more, with subtle special
cases where a
statement may not be true and that can't be overlooked, and it amazes me that there aren't more errors.
Something like Wiles' proof boggles the mind.)
I think that many mathematicians have an ability to perceive things at a
much higher level than I am able to, and this seems to be a talent that
you are either born with or not.  I am to able perceive things this way to
a certain extent, since I obviously have to understand the proofs
to formalize them, but it is often after much pain and hair-pulling.
The whole point of Metamath was to
try to bring this down to a lower level that people such as myself who
aren't so gifted could understand, and the fact that a computer can
&quot;understand&quot; it means, to me, that in principle I can too.  But I
digress...

:: .

:: To answer your question, among these subgoals are often problems whose
proof initially eludes me, and those of course aren't in the book if each
subgoal equals a book sentence.  Often I can't solve them right away,
and the answer will sometimes come the next day, almost automatically.
 When I first started set theory 12 years ago,
the proof of pwpw0 was so frustratingly elusive that I went to the MIT
library and looked in virtually every set theory book, and none of them had
the proof worked out formally.  It was always presented as an &quot;obvious&quot;
step towards some other result.  It's not that I didn't believe it - to
me it was also &quot;obvious,&quot; intuitively - it's just that I couldn't figure
out how to ''formalize'' it.  It was 5 days before I finally figured
it out on my own, going to sleep each night thinking about it.
Given the set.mm tools available at that point,  
it ended up requiring a very tricky (to me at the time) theorem of predicate calculus,
exintr, that I'd never seen in a book and had to stumble across
on my own.
In restrospect, pwpw0 now seems trivial to me, and in the
database its proof is currently reduced to 1 step (using another result).
Perhaps I should put back my original proof for history's sake.
(Later - for anyone who is curious, the original proof is still at the de2.metamath.org &quot;archive&quot; site:
[http://de2.metamath.org/mpegif/pwpw0.html pwpw0].  It is embarrassing to
admit that it took 5 days to figure this out - you can see exintr in step 6 -
but maybe it will help others who are struggling with formal proofs not to
feel so bad.:) )

::: The essential difference between computer programming and
proving mathematical theorems is, in Metamath terminology, that
a Metamath proof cannot modify the proof statement stack. -- [[ocat]] 24-Sep-2006 

:::: A minor nit.  I might be misunderstanding, but it seems you're talking about ''imperative'' programming languages, or perhaps more generally side-effecting languages.  For example, [http://haskell.org Haskell] is a ''purely functional'' language, and has no side effects.  If you are not talking about side effects, I'm not understanding.  -- [[marnix]] 28-Sep-2006

::::: The Metamath Proof Verifier maintains an hypothesis stack
but cannot modify its instruction stack -- the (RPN) proof statements.
See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_automaton, &quot;two-stack
machine&quot;. The Metamath proof language is not Turing equivalent. It
cannot loop, it cannot alter the instruction pointer, etc. A proof
is a list of commands that is executed in a single, unalterable
direction -- just a long computation to compute the formula that
is to be &quot;proved&quot;. --[[ocat]] 28-Sep-2006

* Is there suffering and frustration until a proof
is complete, or is the process &quot;in the zone&quot; where
time disappears and no suffering exists? Or both, depending?

:: There is suffering and frustration.  Most of it is involved in
figuring out how to formalize the original proof, independent of
Metamath, which means the proof and all of its hidden assumptions
and leaps of logic &quot;left to the reader&quot;  must be figured out
in complete detail and understood perfectly.  Once that is done,
for me the process of translating it to Metamath is pretty
mechanical and not usually not very painful if painful at all.
The things I hate the most is having to scrap and re-do a half-completed
proof due to a logical hole I overlooked in the formalization. 
Of course, there is satisfaction and pride once the proof is done,
and that provides a motivating reward.  This feeling for me is
deeper than the satisfaction that I get from say completing a
computer program - since there can be no bugs, it is done once and
for all, and I feel a sense of relief that
I'll never have to worry about it again for the rest of my life.

* Do you ponder relevant issues during your &quot;spare&quot;
time or while doing other things?

:: Yes.

* Is it possible to &quot;get anything done&quot; in less than
a few hours (i.e. the work involves immersion and
construction of complex mental structures in RAM)?

::  That depends.  Long blocks of time are definitely more efficient,
but I carry around a piece of paper with &quot;subgoals&quot; on it to work on as
life's other activities permit.  During these times, the thing that
makes me inefficient is not having metamath/set.mm to browse for
existing theorems whose name/form I forgot.  A little handheld device
the size of a calculator with metamath/set.mm/mmj2-browser on it would
be handy at those times, if such a thing existed.  A big problem with
PDAs, for me, is the lack of a keyboard; I haven't been able to get
used to that (or to those ridiculously tiny keyboards).  But since a keyboard automatically implies greater than
pocket size, such a thing may be physically impossible, so maybe someday
when time/price permits I should try to put metamath on a Linux PDA and
try harder to learn stylus input.

:::  I finally broke down and bought a used PDA on EBay
(Palm Tungsten E)
for $89 + $13 shipping, which came on Wednesday.  This is the
first PDA I've ever owned or used.  I put a simple Metamath
browser on it, and here is a
[http://us2.metamath.org:8888/_screen-palmmm.jpg screenshot].  Now I don't have to lug my laptop around
everywhere.  I couldn't figure out how to put a symbol font on it,
so I settled for ASCII, but that is adequate for what I need.  It holds
all 8300 definitions and theorems in 600KB, so there is
plenty of room for future
expansion (the PDA has 32MB).  I'm still keeping my appointments in
my little red book, since I don't really trust it yet. :)  --[[norm]] 13 Oct 2006


* Do you like proving &quot;just because&quot; you like proving
(it is sufficient unto itself, requires no justification
and is its own reward)?

::  I like seeing the goal and knowing that it has been rigorously
confirmed.  Once it is proved, I don't care that much about the proof
itself anymore (other than being proud of knowing that I did it),
except that the shorter it is, the happier I am with it, to
reduce the size of set.mm.  I don't really expect others to plow through
my proofs except either to use as examples of how to prove things, or to
convince themselves when they are stuck trying to figure out at a higher
level how something is derived (which,
from my own experience, can often be done just by looking at a few
higher-level steps until you grasp the idea).


OK, Thanks for the information -- it is useful stuff that I can
apply to the task of writing the user manual/tutorial
for the mmj2 Proof Assistant GUI. One conundrum I faced is that
the mmj2 PA GUI provides no magic bullet, regardless of the number
of tricks, hints and labor-saving features; the user still has
to get *into* the mindspace, and there is no substitute for
knowing the subject matter (which was never the intention, but
rather to allow subject matter knowledge to predominate in spite
of a lack of knowledge of Metamath statement labels.) I have several
ideas about how to proceed (still procrastinating). A tutorial
will use Proof Worksheet files: example001.txt, example002.txt, etc.,
and the instructional remarks will be comment lines in the Proof
Worksheets. And I am pondering the idea of providing a set of
exercises using the Natural Deduction approach adapted for
Metamath (Hilbert style) -- the completed proofs will then be
re-verified minus the tutorial's &quot;axioms&quot; using just set.mm
as a final educational experience! This will emphasize the
necessity of *knowing*, say, propositional logic prior to
proving propositional logic theorems. And I feel comfortable now
in asserting that when learning a completely new subject a
student is likely to experience discomfort and suffering, but
that these emotions are typical, if not actually necessary!

Wanted: theorems, at least a few in peano.mm!

: I guess no one has volunteered yet, so I'll continue your
request in the &quot;Summary&quot; line. [[norm]] 3-Oct-2006

I tested the mmj2 Proof Assistant with ql.mm, peano.mm and
miu.mm. 

The problem with miu.mm is, I believe, that the
grammar is infinitely ambiguous -- and theorem1's proof
will not unify successfully, as is (I need to graph the
syntax trees and nail this down, but note that &quot;info&quot;
messages are produced during startup of mmj2.bat about
the grammar, and I have examined the ambiguity of miu.mm
extensively in the past and am not surprised to see the
unification problem in action.)

:  The MIU system, unfortunately perhaps, had a strong influence on the
flexibility built into Metamath.  While trying to figure out exactly
what a &quot;formal system&quot; was, I was deceived into thinking that if it
couldn't even handle the trivial MIU, how could it possibly handle
&quot;real&quot; formal systems?  My current feeling is that the substitution with
empty strings that miu.mm requires is ugly and should be forbidden by
the spec.  The problem is that a lot of newcomers tend to be attracted
to miu.mm because it's simple and, being Hofstadter-related, seems to
have a certain coolness factor,
and I'd hate to turn them away.  So empty substitution will stay in the
spec for that purpose, for the time being, but no one should use it in a
new mm database. 

: .

:  In later years I have felt that the real essence or spirit of what
Metamath &quot;should&quot; be is that built into the Metamath Solitaire applet,
with a much more restrictive syntax (split into separate internal RPN
and external human representation) that can still do everything in
set.mm, but cannot do miu.mm or many other creative variations of $a's.
Off and on I have been tempted to drastically revise the Metamath
spec/program/database accordingly, but in the end have felt there is
still a certain convenience to having the source file somewhat
human-readable, which would be lost with RPN.  Now of course there is
Ghilbert, so it would probably be pointless to convert to the Solitaire
method.

: .

:  So, we currently have the somewhat &quot;too flexible&quot; original Metamath,
and we have the more disciplined Ghilbert.  But in a way it perhaps it 
is nice to have a choice, for the
time being.  It can be fun to toy with crazy $a's that people invent,
and usually proving them inconsistent.  :)  And, it appears, people
enjoy writing verifiers for it. --[[norm]] 3-Oct-2006


:: The interesting thing for me about miu.mm
is that if we remove axiom &quot;wxy&quot;, the
proof of the theorem still holds. This is
the only extant example, AFAIK, of a
provable Metamath theorem whose formula
cannot be parsed. That topic/question was a
real boggler for me back in 2004 :) 

:: .

:: A possible project -- or unsolved problem -- for a
Friend of Metamath is to create an
unambiguous context-free grammar for
miu.mm, whether or not it includes 
&quot;empty substitution&quot;.

:: .

:: mmj2 deals with &quot;Nulls Permitted&quot; Syntax
Axioms, which provide the syntactic
mechanism for enabling empty substitution.
For example, &quot;nullWFF $a wff $.&quot; is a
Nulls Permitted Syntax Axiom.

:: .

:: Metamath, as presently defined provides an
excellent playground for both novice language
designers and computer programmer/scientists --
not to mention &quot;mathelogicians&quot; of the
Hilbertian variety (Bertrand Russell would
have really liked Metamath, I am sure!)

::: Imagine how he must have felt knowing that ''Principia
Mathematica'' could collapse like a house of cards if there
was even one slip-up or &quot;bug&quot; in the fragile tangle of
theorems it was built on, with no way to verify it
with certainty and requiring arduous human checking
that at most would reduce the risk.
In his autobiography he wrote,
&quot;My intellect never quite recovered
from the strain of writing it.&quot;



:: Therefore, I recommend leaving in place
&quot;empty substitution&quot; in the Metamath spec and
program, whether or not set.mm uses them.
Null substitutions hold a solid position in
the theory of formal languages -- see:
[ http://www.cs.vu.nl/~dick/PTAPG.html Dick Grune and Ceriel J.H. Jacobs, &quot;Parsing Techniques - A Practical Guide&quot; ]

:: .

:: In the manner discussed in the PTAGP book, mmj2 uses an
algorithm to systematically eliminate null
syntax constructions from the grammar it 
produces. However, a variety of the Earley
Parser algorithm can easily accomodate 
null substitutions -- though the language
designer's task is not so simple!

:: .

:: BTW, Metamath.exe could easily *derive* the
state value &quot;empty substitutions on&quot; by
examining the input syntax axioms for
formula length = 1. 

::: That's a very clever idea; I never thought of it.  I'll add
to my to-do list the automatic setting or even elimination of
the 'set empty_substitition' command.  Please don't
patent it. :)

The problem for the mmj2 Proof Assistant with peano.mm
is that there are no theorems. I accept personal responsibility
for never having invented any, but it would be great if one of
Metamath's fans could write some! The interesting thing 
about peano.mm right now is that it uses *prefix* notation
and it would be nice to see TMFF in action with prefix
syntax.

ql.mm is not a problem. It gets little publicity but 
it works fine with the mmj2 Proof Assistant, and it 
is especially nice to have the Metamath English description
of each theorem displayed on the mmj2 PA GUI screen.

=Questions about EIMM.exe=

1) A quick review of the source code for EIMM did not
indicate that its Import function recognizes or stores
mmj2 Proof Worksheet $d statements. Is that correct?
Is it doable?

:  That is correct.  It is not doable at present, because the present
MM-PA proof assistant has no concept of $d's, which have to be checked with
normal proof verification.  While I have a to-do list item
for it, so far I haven't been motivated to put $d handling
in MM-PA (particularly because it isn't a trivial retrofit the way MM-PA
is written) because it hasn't been a significant problem for me
(and might even be an impediment since I usually put them
in &quot;after the fact,&quot; not always knowing what they will be until
the proof is done).  
It might be a problem for others; I'm not sure.    

2) Is it true that EIMM can only import proofs for theorems
that already exist in the input .mm database?

: That's correct.  You have to be inside of the MM-PA session
of the theorem being imported. 

:: I think it may be time for a utility for batch import of
theorems and proofs, with $d's, etc. Could be a standalone
utility based on the .mmp format. Could be a java program :)
Or C. Or python...lisp...whatever. --[[ocat]]

:::  Yes, this would be nice to have.  As with all such decisions (like
whether to develop a full-blown IDE, etc.) I try to put things into
perspective:  in a practical sense, what are the time savings that the
tool will buy over doing the task via a text editor, compared to the
overall time spent developing a proof?  Except for very simple proofs,
most of the time I spend is working on the proof itself, and the time
needed to place the theorem in the .mm file with a text editor is small
by comparison.  In the very long run, any automation will most likely
pay for itself.  But I am always torn between the time I have available
to develop the content of set.mm and the time neeed to develop
additional automation tools - typically I take the selfish approach of
doing the latter when some repetitive task starts to annoy me.
Hopefully, there will continue to be other people who enjoy tool development
more than formalizing proofs, and I can benefit from their efforts, just
as they can benefit from having the database developed further.
--[[norm]]

:::: Perhaps a new project can provide the additional features 
the customers are demanding :) Adding new theorems and their
proofs manually does not require a lot of time compared to actual
creation/invention, but the limitations require explanation. The
illusion is marred... Did you know that internally mmj2 actually
creates theorem, log hyp and cnst &quot;temp&quot; objects but does not 
reuse them if the user goes on to create another proof -- that is
because the .mm database is not updated and inconsistency would
create its own problems. A metaphor: the tropical garden patch
near the swimming pool at our house... I spent a couple of hours
pruning and cleaning it, generating half a recycling container
of waste. After I was done no one noticed anything different!
My work was of such high quality that I made the garden look
exactly like it was supposed to look, therefore the changes were
invisible to the eye of the casual observer. --[[ocat]] 



3) Is it possible to execute EIMM for Export and Import via
a batch command file? If so, can provide example statement?
That would be a great feature for regression testing!

: If I understand you correctly, I think so.  For example, the
manually typed:

        ...
        MM&gt; prove a1i
        MM-PA&gt; submit eimmexp.cmd
        ...

: can be put into a complete metamath session on one line of a
batch command file, thus:

        metamath &quot;r set.mm&quot; &quot;prove a1i&quot; &quot;submit eimmexp.cmd&quot; &quot;ex&quot; &quot;ex&quot;

: (I haven't tried this but I assume it will work.)

:: OK, thanks. That works. I'll have to try the eimmimp.cmd version -- (note to self: remember to add the &quot;save&quot;). --[[ocat]] 

::: Don't be shy about changing the .cmd's themselves, or creating
your own, if it would
be beneficial; they are just
scripts to let metamath talk to the actual eimm program.  'eimm --help'
describes the usage of the eimm program itself, which normally isn't - but
could be - used on a standalone basis.  Note that
in a .cmd, a line in quotes is sent to the OS, although I try to avoid
that since it makes the script OS-dependent.  The metamath 'tools'
command can do limited file manipulations to achieve some OS independence.
--[[norm]] 10-Oct-2006 

4) Is it possible to modify EIMM to not produce all of those
work files, and to just have it operate in memory -- this behavior
clutters up the user directory. If not, can it tidy up after
itself? 

: It currently needs work files, since it is outside of the metamath
program and it &quot;talks&quot; to metamath via the metamath 'submit'
command, which reads in a file, and metamath &quot;talks&quot; to it via
logged output (show proof, etc.).

: .

: A possible solution would be to add it as native metamath commands,
in which case intermediate files could theoretically be avoided.  But I don't have
time to do that right away, and anyway I want to accumulate some
eimm experiences (such as the one you are reporting here) before making that big a change
to the metamath program.  For example,
your report will provide a motivation
for keeping all work internal.

: .

: As an intermediate solution I can have it delete the temporary
files when done.  Also, maybe I can add a '/silent' qualifier to 
'submit' to suppress  the screen output.  I'll look at that.

: .

: The old versions of the proof worksheet are renamed to 
~1, ~2, etc. instead of deleted.  I personally would prefer to keep
those since such &quot;journaled&quot; files
have allowed me to recover work countless times.  They can be periodically purged with 'rm *~*' (or the
equivalent in Windows).  But if people feel strongly about it, 
maybe I 
could add a '/no_journal' qualifier to 'open log' and eimm.

=Yahoo Interstellar Time Capsule=

[http://www.physorg.com/news79706582.html  Yahoo set out on Monday to capture life on Earth in digital formats for a &quot;time capsule&quot; to be buried in Silicon Valley as well as beamed from Mexico into the cosmos.]

I would have submitted Metamath's set.mm and ql.mm but the Yahoo page
for this project required Flash software, which I abjure for security
reasons. 

If anything deserves to be beamed into the cosmos, it is Metamath's
set.mm database, which is one of mankind's most beautiful works
of epistemological glory. I have no doubt that aliens would be able
to decipher the Metamath .mm file format, which is self-defining
and is capable of constructing logic and math from first principles.
(I suspect they would struggle with the $d statements though :)

Would someone do the honors of informing Yahoo about their most
qualified new &quot;astronaut&quot;?

= Identity card =

I have added a Metamath identity card http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamath in the spirit of what exists for wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia. As you can notice yourself it's not terrific. Any idea ? I find the Octave identity card particularly nice (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Octave). -- [[fl]] 

= Mirrors =

The mirrors are no longer updated . Something broken ? fl

I usually keep them updated about once a week, although it slipped
recently due to a problem with the AU mirror that has been fixed.  I
will try to update the mirrors in a day or so.  I don't update them more
often (e.g. daily) because the rsync's bring my home network to a crawl. -- [[norm]] 31 Oct 2006
