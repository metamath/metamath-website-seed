 Many theorems are borrowed from Megill's set.mm. When a theorem is in
 this case, it is marked by a  '(#05)' or by '(#06)' which means that 
 the theorem has been borrowed from set.mm v. 6-Jun-2005 or v. 22-Jan-2006.
 When the name of the theorem is different it is indicated. When a
 theorem has not been borrowed from set.mm an underscore is
 appended to its front. 
 
 In the rest of this file a ??? means I have a doubt, whatever the doubt
 can be: a doubt about a logic concept, the english language, a
 fact... Anybody giving me some relief about any of these doubts will
 be welcome.
 
 This file is a work in progress. I prefer to give it now in case it
 can be useful. But it can be widely improved.
 
 This file is the work of an amateur. It can be not completely sound 
 (I know... the wording seems strange but it means exactly what I mean).
 For a completely sound piece of work see set.mm
 
 Natural deduction was invented by Gentzen in the 30's (cf. Gentzen, 
 Untersuchungen uber das logische Schliessen (Mathematische Zeitschrift 
 39, pp. 176-210, 405-431 1934-5)). His aim was to give a logic system
 where propositional and predicate calculus proofs would be easier to
 make than in previously designed systems (cf. for example D.Hilbert,
 W.Ackermann. Grundzuge der theoretischen Logik. Berlin (Springer),
 1928).
 
 To achieve this goal Gentzen uses a list of hypotheses (called
 context in this file).
 
 Our system is not exactly the system designed by Gentzen but it can be
 considered as a descendant of it. A descendant of the Hilbert
 system is obviously the system described by Norman Megill in set.mm
 
 To understand exactly how Gentzen derived his own system from the
 Hilbert's system I recommend the reading of ` Introduction to 
 metamathematics ` by Kleene chapter V (In fact I'm not sure in
 this chapter Kleene tries to derive Gentzen's system from Hilbert's one 
 but it can really be read that way.
 
 In ` nat.mm `  every formula has the following form : ` # G |- ph `.
 ` # ` has no particular meaning. It is mandatory in metamath to begin
 formula with a constant and it is the only purpose of this symbol. ` G `
 is the context. ` ph ` is the formula we want to prove and '|-' signals
 a derivation. Then ` # G |- ph ` should be read: from the
 hypotheses in G we can derive ph. In a certain way in Hilbert's
 system we make proof about propositions and in Gentzen's we make
 proof about derivations. 
 
 The system described below has been inspired by slides by
 Christoph Benzmuller called from 'Natural Deduction to
 Sequent Calculus and back'. It can be found there:
 
    http://www.ags.uni-sb.de/~chris/papers/2002-pisa.pdf
 
 In this set of slides, the relationship between various forms of
 natural deduction, and between natural deduction and sequent calculus
 (another logic system designed by Gentzen) is exposed. Some reasons
 explaining why Gentzen's systems are theoritically important are also
 described. 
 
 In particular I borrow to Benzmuller's slides the way to represent
 the list of hypotheses by a context appended to the left of a
 formula. 
 
 Benzmuller himself had used, among other sources, a paper by Franck
 Pfenning called  ` Automated theorem proving `. 
 
   http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/courses/atp/handouts.html
 
 All the axioms concerning propositional calculus, predicate calculus,
 equality come from this paper.
 
 However the system described by Pfenning is not rich enough to work
 with in metamath. En effet ??? it presupposes substitutions are
 realized at a metalogical level  (i. e. by an independant device). In
 metamath such a device doesn't  exist. Thus we must add axioms to
 make our system able to deal with substitution simply by handling
 axioms and inferences belonging to the system ). To achieve
 metalogical completeness I simply added 'set.mm' axioms (thanks to a
 suggestion by Norman Megill).
 
 O'cat suggests me to add an empty context. This is a great idea: see
 ax-con for more explanation.
 
 In his paper Pfenning asks some variables are new. However he doesn't
 describe what he means by 'new'. This proviso ( this is the technical 
 name of that sort of requirement ) can be a $d statement. Or it can simply 
 mean there is no free occurence of the variable.
 
 Norman Megill urged me to interpret 'new' as meaning distinct (i.e. using a $d 
 statement), because it is easier to make a parallel between proofs in
 nat.mm and in set.mm this way.
 
 I have tried to realize a natural deduction system with a 
 $d x G $. statement as its proviso. And I found it very difficult
 to be used. If anybody  wants to know what pain and sorrow mean in
 logic I agree to send him/her this attempt.
 
 Realizing this sort of proviso is too much for my humble strenght, I
 replaced them with a 'bound x G' proviso. This is much more
 comfortable.
 
 Note: [ terminology ] In this file we call axiom a rule which has no 
 proof. We call theorem a rule which has a proof. When a rule has one 
 hypothesis or more we call it a rule of inference. When it has no 
 hypothesis we simply call it an axiom or a theorem. A synonym for 
 hypothesis is premisse. A formula or a statement is any group of symbols that
 respect the rules of syntax. The last statement of a rule of
 inference is its conclusion. In a ` # G |- ph ` statement any formula
 in G is called an hypothesis, ph is called a conclusion. We are aware
 that our terms are higly overloaded and correspond to various
 reality. In ` Introduction to metamathematics ` Kleene uses a more
 precise dictionary. However we think these overloadings can be used
 quite naturally and correspond to the structure of ` metamath ` itself
 and to the the usual use of these terms.
 
 Note: [ Scheme ] We use the term axiom for brievity sake but we
 should say 'scheme of axiom' to speak correctly.
 
 Note: [ Importation ] When we import a theorem from set.mm we can use 
 several strategy. The simplest one consists in adding a '# bound x G' 
 hypothesis (it is useless in propositional calculus but it may be
 mandatory in predicate calculus). As an alternative we can prefer
 binding the hypotheses. In that case we can remove the '# bound x G' 
 hypothesis. The third way for importing theorems is to transform a 
 set.mm theorem into a closed form. To do that simply turn the
 hypotheses into antecedents. ph &amp; ps =&gt; ch is changed into 
 ( ph -&gt; ( ps -&gt; ch ) ). You can have to quantify the hypothesis if
 you have a predicate calculus theorem. In that case the closed form
 will be ( A. x ph -&gt; ( A. x ps -&gt; ch ) ) .
 
 Note: [ Syntax of this file ] In the first column there must always
 be a space in order that nat.mm looks nice on the wiki. 
 
 Note: Here is a plan of the system.
 
 1 -- Natural deduction propositional calculus axioms are introduced.
 
  1.1 -- I proved back set.mm propositional calculus axioms
 
   'set.mm' propositional calculus axioms have been slightly
   transformed. I appended G in front of them. According to ax-con I
   can do this.
 
   This shows my own system is complete regarding propositional
   calculus.
 
 2 -- Natural deduction predicate calculus axioms are introduced.
 
  2.1 -- These are ax-ui, ax-ue, ax-ee, ax-ei, ax-eq.
 
  2.2 -- When Pfenning asked that a variable should be 'new' I've
  translated it by 'bound'.
 
      3.2.1 According to me, 'new' in ax-ui means the variable must
      be bound in  all the statements in G.
 
      3.2.2 According to me 'new' in ax-ee means the variable must be
      bound in all the staments in G and in ps (but not in ps since
      in this case the inference would be meaningless).
 
  2.3 -- Pfenning's system supposes variable substitution is managed
  at a metalogical level. Since in metamath we can't do that I added
  axioms.
 
 3 -- I added axioms to decide if a variable is bound in a formula. 
 
      4.1 These axioms are in some way independant from the rest of
      the system. On the contrary theorems about bound variables in
      set.mm are completely integre to the system.
 
         4.1.1 The reason why I add axioms about bound variables is
         that I don't want to use the $d statement and therefore I
         need a device to emulate the 'new' proviso used by
         Pfenning. This device is the set of axioms about binding.
 
 4 -- I added an axiom to manage substitution.
 
      4.1 This is fs.
 
 5 -- I added an axiom to manage equality.
 
      5.1 This axiom is equsb1
 
          5.1.1 I don't know if we must add to axiom. I have added it
          because it was difficult for me to prove it. But perhaps it
          will reveal itself to be redundant.
 
 6 -- There remains some axioms that can't be proved.
 
     6.1 These axioms are setax-10, setax-11, setax-12 and setax-16.
 
 7 -- I added a meta property about context.
 
     7.1 This is called ax-con.
 
     7.2 This inference rule allows me to remove unnecessary
     provisos.
 
     7.3 It is a justification of the reason why I can import closed
    form theorems from set.mm.

 $(  This axiom means that if a statement can be derived from an empty context,
 it can be derived from any context. It's a sort of ax-we axiom but with an 
 undefined number of hypotheses. ( Since this axiom is a sort of extension
 of ax-we I think we could prove it as a meta theorem. That's the reason
 why I called it a meta axiom. )
 
 This meta axioms explains why we can import closed form theorem
 from set.mm into nat.mm. By closed form I mean $p statement without
 $e hypotheses. But we can't import inferences as easily. (??? example)
 
 This meta axiom has another function: it is used to prevent a
 'bound x G' proviso in theorems without hypotheses ($e statement):
 see for instance eqcom. $)

 $)</pre><h2>New version of nat.mm</h2><p>Predicate axioms have no substitution operator any longer. I think the system fully works now. Several propositional and pure predicate theorems have been added. Set theory axioms have been added as well. All the code mandatory to generate html pages has been added. I have gif images (you can ask me them). Last but not least I have begun to fix the mistakes in the commentaries.</p><p>In the future however I think I will replace set theory by another theory (like peano arithmetic) because it is a bit stupid to try to add all set.mm set theory theorems. However I intend to add all the propositional and predicate theorems in set.mm ( at least those of 1993 ). This way it will be able to do interesting things with nat.mm.</p><p>Another thing that can be tried would be to implement intuitionistic logic in nat.mm ( few modifications to do, at least for the logic axioms [ but certainly many problems with the definitions in set theory ] ). This way we could have a full intuitionistic system. But I guess it's too difficult for me.</p><p>&#x2013; 28-Jul-2006 <a class="local" href="frl">frl</a></p></div><div class="footer"><hr /><span class="gotobar bar"><a class="local" href="HomePage">HomePage</a> <a class="local" href="RecentChanges">RecentChanges</a> </span><span class="edit bar"><br /> <a class="edit" accesskey="e" title="Click to edit this page" href="http://planetx.cc.vt.edu/AsteroidMeta?action=edit;id=Natural_deduction_based_metamath_system">Edit this page</a> <a class="history" href="http://planetx.cc.vt.edu/AsteroidMeta?action=history;id=Natural_deduction_based_metamath_system">View other revisions</a> <a class="admin" href="http://planetx.cc.vt.edu/AsteroidMeta?action=admin;id=Natural_deduction_based_metamath_system">Administration</a></span><span class="time"><br /> Last edited 2006-12-06 17:16 UTC by <a class="author" title="from outgw.lumigent.com" href="jorend">jorend</a> <a class="diff" href="http://planetx.cc.vt.edu/AsteroidMeta?action=browse;diff=1;id=Natural_deduction_based_metamath_system">(diff)</a></span><form method="get" action="http://planetx.cc.vt.edu/AsteroidMeta" enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded">
