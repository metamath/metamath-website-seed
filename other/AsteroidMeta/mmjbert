I am finally starting to really "dig" Ghilbert. I like many things about it very much. So I am considering stealing as much as possible from Ghilbert which is 100% consistent with direct convertability between it and Metamath. This means another flavor of Ghilbert, which I would tenatively name "mmjbert" because the dialect would provide services to the totally hypothetical vaporware product, "mmj3" (which we would like to be able to handle multi-core, multi-computer parallel/distributed processing environments.)</p><p>Here are the main concept variations from Ghilbert Prime:</p><h1>1) Definitions.</h1><p>Definitions of the Ghilbert variety revert to being just Axioms, as they are in Metamath. I believe I see what the intent is for Ghilbert definitions and it is admirable but de-selected for mmjbert. Here is why.</p><p>Look at the "definition" for df-3or. This is an equivalency back to "2or" --&gt;</p><pre>     ( ph \/ ps \/ ch \/ ) &lt;-&gt; ( ( ph \/ ps ) \/ ch )
   </pre><p>Which is fine, of course. But according to the Ghilbert specification, during proof verification when a definition is encountered during the matching process, and it doesn't match its corresponding node, the definition is expanded, which is totally logical of course. But it is treating df-3or as syntactic sugar. And that is "ok" too, except that it will not fly in Metamath, which is what mmjbert must service.</p><p>Metamath has a number of "syntactic sugar" syntax axioms. In fact, except for the "atomic" undefined syntax, all of the syntax axioms in set.mm can be viewed as syntactic sugar! Consider wex and wrex, for example:</p><pre>    wex $a wff E. x ph $.
    wrex $a wff E. x e. A ph $.
    </pre><p>Notice that the "E." operator is contained in both formulas? That is typical of other set.mm syntax axioms. Norm has created a language in set.mm which is a compromise between the "pure" languages of math/logic which use polish prefix syntax and the constant/parentheses ( "(", ")" ) punctuated context-free grammars of programming languages. Unfortunately, the Metamath Proof Verification Engine algorithm cannot tolerate syntactic ambiguities, whatsoever &#x2013; if "(" and ")" are used in a syntax axiom once, then they are used all of the time!</p><p>It is possible to define a context free grammar using a Metamath .mm file which really does treat ")" and "(" as grouping delimiters. But the Proof Verifier will require that a "normal" form be used; no extra or omitted parentheses can be tolerated because the Proof Verifier compares formula strings. To deal with syntactic sugar in Metamath, the Metamath specification would require modification so that input .mm formulas are parsed and converted to a normal form &#x2013; and then on output/display, the normal form is converted back to some other form, probably the original.</p><p>And if you look inside set.mm, df-3or actually appears inside proofs. So if you want to treat df-3or as syntactic sugar in your 'bert dialect then you must have a way to do a Hilbert-style derivation from your proof step formulas to the original-style Metamath formulas. Which is theoretically doable&#x2026;but huge, if you plan to accomplish that for every set.mm definition.</p><p>Another "whine" I have about the Ghilbert definition concept is unfolding the definitions during unification/proof verification. In mmjbert I would prefer that these algorithms not be burdened with a need for intelligence. If unfolding is required, I prefer that happen explicitly, upstream, by someone/something smarter.</p><p>Really, I think, what the goal is for the Ghilbert definition feature is something which I would term "sub- formulas". Here is how I would describe "sub-formulas"&#x2026;</p><p>Say we have a "term" which is repeated in many places in a proof, such that it is tedious to write and hard to look at (except by the original author who has the stuff hardwired in the cerebral cortex&#x2026;) For example, say your are working on "E = m * c ** 2" and you decide to call this sub-formula/expression just "Q" and then in all of your proof steps whenever you write "Q" it is <i>understood</i> that "Q" expands to "E = m * c ** 2". In other words, this sub-formula feature is exactly like a mmj2 "Work Variable" except that Work Variables are automatically resolved whenever the substitution information becomes available to the program, and a "sub-formula" is defined by the user and is implicitly resolved within the proof worksheet syntactically prior to all unification/verification processing.</p><p>In summary, my perspective is not that the Ghilbert way "bad", but that in Metamath's set.mm, Norm has used considerable judgement to form "hybrid" syntax objects which could be untangled to a "pure" form, and that the job of doing the untangling should not reside in mmjbert &#x2013; that is something which should belong in the user interface portion of mmj3/whatever (and will need to be smart enough to figure out how to deal with df-or and df-3or in a way which is convenient for users.)</p><h1>2. Axioms.</h1><p>Axioms are back, in mmjbert. Again, the Ghilbert way is a good way, but it goes beyond the objectives of mmj3/mmjbert (which is to provide unparalleled quality of service to people doing Metamath.)</p><h1>3. Variables and Variable Hypotheses.</h1><p>These are a pain in the brain, so they're gone! At least, they aren't <i>declared</i> in mmjbert. Variables such as "ph" and "x" belone to the user-interface space. Who cares what they're named inside the system? All we care about is their Type/Kind (e.g. wff, class, set, etc.)</p><p>Here is how to eliminate Var/VarHyp<a class="edit" title="Click to edit this page" href="http://planetx.cc.vt.edu/AsteroidMeta?action=edit;id=VarHyp">?</a> declarations in mmjbert: assertions and formulas will use "call signatures" in exactly the same way these are used in C, Java, etc., except that we won't even both to provide argument names&#x2026;just the types &#x2013; which is the same way that "term"s are defined in Ghilbert.</p><p>So, every assertion and every formula will have its own "call pattern". For example (this is an illustration of the concept, not the actual implementation):</p><pre>    wff ax-mp(wff wff)
    </pre><p>Inside ax-mp, the program refers to wff-1 and wff-2.</p><p>There are a few reasons for doing this. One of which is that it is a pain in the brain to have to deal with Metamath's scopes and frames when working inside a Proof Assistant. Let the program use as many wff variables as it wants, who cares? The only time we need to care is when we are exporting a Proof Worksheet back to Metamath, and in that case, if there aren't enough wff variables at the global level, then someone can deal with that manually or with a very smart program who knows how to update-in-place a .mm file.</p><p>Another reason for doing this is that we want to maximize "locality of reference" when doing parallel/distributed code. To accomplish this we want each Assertion to carry his own baggage with him so that he can function in new environments without referring back to the original context. Soooooo&#x2026;</p><p>An Assertion has its own self-contained Frame ( &#x2013; and we just abandon the concept of "optional variables, by the way!) For example (keeping this illustrative of the concept but not showing the actual implementation, here is the ax-mp assertion and frame:</p><pre>    [ |- ax-mp  (wff, wff) ():
        [ |- .1  (wff, wff) : wi(1, 2) ]
        [ |- .2  (wff) : 1 ]
        [ |- .0  (wff) : 2 ]
        ( h1(1 , 2), h2(1), qed(2) )
    ]</pre><p>Notice that this ax-mp has its own Mandatory Variable "frame" info stating its call variable types and distinct variable requirement (none).</p><p>And notice that each Formula has its own call pattern, which is like a "mini-frame" (but without the $d's.) The idea behind this is that we really want each Formula to be a self-contained entity so that we can dispatch Formulas for unification and unification searching, etc.</p><p>Finally, be assured that there is no expectation that users would deal with these cryptic references directly. We provide the hypothetical and largely theoretical possibility of manually manipulating the mmjbert data structures, but don't intend for them to be used that way. The idea is that a .mm file will be read and converted into mmjbert file(s) &#x2013; which can then be further processed by mmj3. Which leads to the next idea&#x2026;</p><h1>4. Modularization</h1><p>It has been observed that set.mm can be broken down and linearly arranged by Book, Chapter and Section. A "Section" is a chunk of set.mm which introduces new syntax, defines the syntax and plays around with it. A "Chapter" contains new axioms as well as new syntax. "Book" is just a somewhat arbitrary grouping of Chapters. So the Book of Logic might contain Propositional and Predicate Logic Chapters. (Logically, ax-3 should be moved down in set.mm to the place where it is first ("allowed to be") used.)</p><p>One thing I think we can achieve easily is to extract slices of information from set.mm which are "less fragile", meaning that some changes to set.mm won't wipe out what we do downstream from it.</p><p>For example, as we all know, every statement in a .mm file is assigned a sequence number which is used to prevent circular references (an entity can only use other entities with lower sequence numbers than its own.) We would like to be able to easily add theorems without altering the subsequent theorem sequence numbers (yeah, that would be nice!) So perhaps we can assign sequence numbers by math object within section, where sections are numbered 001, 002, &#x2026; 99999 and 001 is the first set.mm section and 999999 is the last. Then, if Section 23 has 94 objects, we allow the user to add AT THE END of Section 23 and assign the sequence number 95. (To add in the middle of Section 23 the user would have to put the new theorem into the source .mm file and then regenerate the mmjbert files.) So, other theorems referencing the new theorem would refer to it as "23.95" &#x2013; but only interally within the code&#x2026;users would refer to the new theorem by name using the Proof Assistant.</p><p>The real benefit of this scheme occurs when there are 1+ million theorems in a .mm repository, and therefore, it is expensive to regenerate all of the downstream stuff&#x2026; Because syntax and logical axioms rarely change or move -- they occur at the beginning of each Section &#x2013; their sequence numbers are fairly durable. So it is fairly doable to determine is we need to regenerate our Grammatical Parser (or our 3D V/R avatars :-) We just output separate syntax/axiom export files and compare them to the previous version &#x2013; if no change, then no need to regenerate the Grammar!!! And, if the syntax/axiom delta- data shows a change we know that there may be other manual intervention needed for downstream systems!</p><p>Here is a more detailed "vision" of how this would work:</p><p>a) Separate each "Section" into two parts, Syntax and Logic.</p><p>b) Syntax sections are assigned odd numbers, Logic even. So Section 1 is syntax, (early propositional), and  Section 2 is logic, Section 3 is syntax (introduces &lt;-&gt;), Section 4 is logic.</p><p>c) Each assertion is assigned a sequence number within its section, which is qualified by Section Number. This is tedious in usage but enables us to maintain a statement numbering scheme that can be used &#x2013; internally &#x2013; for subscripting into tables (if the programmer desires). So "wi" is assigned key 1.1 (or 1-1 or &lt;1 1&gt; &#x2026; whatever) and "ax-1" is assigned key 2.1.</p><p>d) Each sub-section is written out to a separate export file as Metamath 7-bit ASCII formatted in s-expressions, and is zipped to minimize size/transmission times. A sha1 key is also generated for each zipped export file.</p><p>e) A separate file containing a list of all exported files and their sha1 keys is produced. This file may also contain parameter settings (e.g. "|-" is the theorem type), or it may contain an entry specifying a parameter/option file.</p><p>f) As a concession to brevity, Type Codes ("kinds" in ghilbert) are output without a Section Number in the export files, and are assigned sequence numbers 1, 2, 3, &#x2026; Separately, a Type Code file is output which contains "pointers" to the Section where the Type Code is first introduced. (A separate set of export files will need to be defined for the Metamath grammar&#x2026;and typesetting information &#x2013; that is a big specification task and I defer it for this moment.)</p><p>g) The export files are available, either within a local filesystem or over a network. The sha1 checksums can be used to determine whether or not a given file needs to be re-downloaded/imported. And, the syntax assertions are split from the logic statements providing efficient access for grammar processors &#x2013; plus, since we will allow statements to be added at the end of  a section, it will be possible to add new syntax without altering sequence numbers of logic statements.</p><p>h) I envision adding a mmjbert extract process to mmj2, either as an integral part accessible via RunParm<a class="edit" title="Click to edit this page" href="http://planetx.cc.vt.edu/AsteroidMeta?action=edit;id=RunParm">?</a> commands, or as a separate program which calls the mmj2 code modules but is not loaded or referenced in any way by mmj2 users. The benefit of using mmj2 for the extract is that mmj2 does very extensive validation of each input .mm file, so if mmj2 doesn't report any errors during the file load process, then the output mmjbert files are pretty much guaranteed to be clean &#x2013; this is a vitally important consideration given that one would expect the code which reads in mmjbert files to do minimal validation of  its input (&#x2013; just read and run.) Also, mmj2 could remain in memory available for callbacks, say, if a Proof Worksheet needed to be Unified to generate a Metamath RPN proof (in mmj2bert, as with ghilbert, the low-level format of the proofs will not exactly match the Metamath specification, so a converter <i>to</i> Metamath format is needed.)</p><p>i) To minimize referential (external key) lookups  (as we know Metamath files are hierarchies with  many intra-hierarchy references), in the export files and possibly internally in code using them, assertion references would be written out <i>with</i> the Type Code. So, "wi" would be written out as "1-1-2" (i.e. Section 1, statement label "wi", statement type = "wff"). And since the parse/proof trees (or s-expressions) convey the number of operands for each operator, all of the information needed for unification is conveyed as part of each statement's data &#x2013; there is no need to do a lookup to find out the type code of "wi" or how many operands it has. This means that in a distributed/ parallel processing environment, little algorithms can be written to do many of the tedious tasks and those algorithms won't need access to the entire set of data structures &#x2013; we'll design the export files to facilitate these tasks, and since we're using sequence numbers instead of text labels/operators, in those cases where lookups are needed, they will be direct subscript accesses!</p><h1>More Ideas!</h1><p>1. To avoid dealing with "optional" variables and optional Dj Variable restrictions, the mmjbert  export format proofs will consist of s-expression trees containing only the label/keys of logical assertions and hypotheses. This means that any downstream code that wishes to display or fully instantiate a proof will need to perform a unification process to generate variable substitutions to generate complete formulas for proof steps. But that is "ok" because doing unification for one proof is intricate but not a massive computational task and existing proofs are not frequently used. Also, these "macro-level proofs" are more durable and resistant to change. In fact, the mmjbert format could be used to <i>import</i> proofs back into mmj2.</p><p>2. Why compress mmjbert export files? Because  it is faster to transport and un-zip a compressed file than to transport an unzipped file. The primary objective of mmjbert &#x2013; why invest lifespan even thinking about it &#x2013; is to facilitate distributed/parallel processing for Metamath databases, whether on a local cluster of multi-core processors or over the internet. For example, suppose there are 'n' possible solutions for a single proof step (e.g. we don't know which assertion to use as justification but we know that there are 'n' unifiable assertions). Then it is possible to create <i>n</i> proof skeletons and ship them out for processing &#x2013; and those processors could operate  independently and either solve the problem, or break it down and and distribute new requests.</p><p>3. Aside from typesetting information, which is of concern only for modules with external, user-oriented interfaces, there are two types of statements: syntax axioms and logic statements (logic hypotheses, logic axioms, and theorems &#x2013; we can disregard syntax theorems as they are artifacts of metamath.exe and reside only inside metamath.exe generated RPN proofs.)</p><p>Now, for syntax statements and logic statements there are 'm' and 'n' attributes for each statement type. One idea which mmjbert will explore is generating use-specific export files containing only subsets of the available attributes.</p><p>The main example of this is separating actual proofs from the logic statements, based on the idea that existing proofs are rarely accessed. (The other main example is splitting the syntax and logic statements into completely different files!)</p><p>Additional situations will likely be discovered during the specification/design process. The benefits of slicing the data "rows" this way are that a) the amount of data which needs to be distributed can be minimized; b) specific processing code can be simpler, faster and more robust if not burdened with extraneous information.</p><p>4. My next step is to refine these ideas into something elegant. Get rid of words, add pictures, create file specs, etc. So far this line of attack has not generated any interest or feedback, but I believe that it will be possible to create a fun and useful project. Perhaps I can get kick the can far enough down the road so that sub-projects in distributed/parallel programming will be available for the 2009 GSOC. (Note to self: find some academic/corporate justification to back this up.)</p><h1>Chapters and Sections</h1><p>I manually entered (chapter) and section numbers using the mmtheorems page at metamath.org. It would be interesting to see these graphed &#x2013; say, on a sphere, with lightning bolts generated (and sound) from proof steps to justifying assertion&#x2026;triggering chain reactions to those theorems' justifying assertions. Or, each section could be a spherical ship in orbit around a sun, with proof steps generating messages between proof steps and justifying assertions.</p><p>Table of Contents &#x2013; metamath.org:8888 set.mm as of 20080518</p><pre>    (01) Pre-logic

    </pre><p>FYI, if you ever want to automate this, here is the algorithm the metamath program uses. It is basically an ad-hoc, informal "standard" based on the characteristics the set.mm program happened to have when I added the theorem list command.</p><pre>  MM&gt; help write theorem_list
  ...
  The first output file, "mmtheorems.html", includes a Table of Contents.
  An entry is triggered in the database by "$(" immediately followed by a
  new line starting with either "#*#*" (for a section break) or "=-=-"
  (for a subsection break).  The line following that one that will be used
  for the table of contents entry, after trimming spaces.  In between two
  successive statements that generate web pages (i.e. $a and $p
  statements), only the last section and/or subsection break will be used,
  and any subsection break before a section break will be ignored.  See the
  set.mm database file for examples.</pre><pre>  [Warning: For matching, white space is NOT ignored.  There should be no
  spaces between "$(" and the end of the line.  This may be allowed in
  a future version, if a request is made to N. Megill.]</pre><p>&#x2013; <a class="local" href="norm">norm</a> 20 May 2008</p><p>Thanks. Whitespace ought to be whitespace. I suggest modifying the criteria so that if the first token of a comment's content (exclusive of the '$(' token) begins with "#*#*#*#*" then that  indicates a section break, and likewise for sub-sections.</p><dl class="quote"><dt /><dd>Request noted and tentatively approved. While this is of course not hard to do, the only drawback is that relaxing the "standard" means that future parsers (e.g. a quick-and-dirty ad-hoc, one off script that extracts sections) will have a slightly harder job.</dd></dl><p>Also, it looks like "Axiom of dependent choice" is missing a sub-secion break. In that case the sub-section title defaults to the section title, yes?</p><dl class="quote"><dt /><dd>Well, it has no sub-section - it is a single theorem with variants. The program doesn't default to anything - there is no sub-section entry. But if you need a sub-section, the default you suggest should be ok.</dd></dl><p>Also, I wonder if you might not want to add a break element for Volume &#x2013; Preliminaries, Propositional, Predicate, Set Theory, blah-blah.</p><dl class="quote"><dt /><dd>I'll think about that.</dd></dl><p>Furthermore, I like the nomenclature: Volume, Chapter, Section.</p><p>Lastly, somewhat unrelated, I wonder if "Sandbox" is diminutive and could be changed to "Truth Mine" or "Mining Claim". To me, a sandbox is a place for children or cats to do business :-)</p><dl class="quote"><dt /><dd>I believe the term "sandbox" is a standard technical term in <a class="url outside" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_%28computer_security%29">computer security</a> and <a class="url outside" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_%28software_development%29">software development</a>, meaning a protected place for testing or running untrusted code. That, essentially, is also its purpose in set.mm. Basically it has a connotation of caveat emptor: I don't guarantee, for example, that the sandbox user hasn't added an inconsistent axiom. This makes life easier for me, since I can more or less put in a user's submission blindly without spending time doing a careful review. As for "Truth Mine" or "Mining Claim", I'm not sure if anyone would understand what that means. :)</dd></dl><p>And, should the Sandbox sections be at the end of set.mm? That way it is simple to exclude them from load processes which specify a single endpoint.</p><dl class="quote"><dt /><dd>Yes, that's a good idea. I'll do that. &#x2013; <a class="local" href="norm">norm</a> 21 May 2008</dd></dl><p>P.S. I now see that the next logical mmj2 project is creation of an Interface interface for exporting data. In practice export code would be in separate load modules and not part of the regular mmj2 download.

And, having the facility in place will make it super easy for future programmers to access .mm databases in pre-parsed, pre-validated mode. --<a class="local" href="ocat">ocat</a> 21-May-2008</p></div><div class="footer"><hr /><span class="gotobar bar"><a class="local" href="HomePage">HomePage</a> <a class="local" href="RecentChanges">RecentChanges</a> </span><span class="edit bar"><br /> <a class="edit" accesskey="e" title="Click to edit this page" href="http://planetx.cc.vt.edu/AsteroidMeta?action=edit;id=mmjbert">Edit this page</a> <a class="history" href="http://planetx.cc.vt.edu/AsteroidMeta?action=history;id=mmjbert">View other revisions</a> <a class="admin" href="http://planetx.cc.vt.edu/AsteroidMeta?action=admin;id=mmjbert">Administration</a></span><span class="time"><br /> Last edited 2008-05-22 01:21 UTC by <a class="author" title="from 207-172-220-9.c3-0.lex-ubr2.sbo-lex.ma.cable.rcn.com" href="norm">norm</a> <a class="diff" href="http://planetx.cc.vt.edu/AsteroidMeta?action=browse;diff=1;id=mmjbert">(diff)</a></span><form method="get" action="http://planetx.cc.vt.edu/AsteroidMeta" enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded">
