You are asked to place in the public domain any contribution you make to
the various databases, so that the databases can remain public-domain
documents.  (If you wish to retain copyright to your work, you are free
to branch a public-domain database into a copyrighted work of your own.)

<P>Ordinarily, I will request that any patch or enhancement to a program
I have written be placed in the public domain, because eventually I may
place the program in the public domain.  (If you wish to retain
copyright to your patch or enhancement, you are free to branch the
program into your own version with a compatible copyright license.)

<H2><FONT COLOR="#006633">Editorial Comment on Public Domain</FONT></H2>
</CENTER>

<P>After considering a number of copyright licensing alternatives, I
have concluded that for mathematical proofs, public domain is in the
best spirit and tradition of mathematics.  This is a personal decision,
but I think that acknowledgment of my work is best dealt with through
courtesy and ethics rather than under threat of a lawsuit, which is what
a copyright license essentially entails.  Plagiarizers will have their
own consciences (and reputations) to deal with, and I have more
important things to do with my time than to worry about them.

<P>Ultimately I can envision mathematical proof databases that will be
shared and built on, and there can be gray areas as to what constitutes
a copyright contribution.  For example, if a proof is shortened or
rewritten completely, at what point does the original contributor's
"ownership" cease?  Or proofs may be merged together, or a theorem may
be restated and reproved in a more convenient form, ideas or pieces of
one proof may be borrowed for use in another, and so on.

<P>A public domain proof database provides complete freedom from
distraction by such issues, allowing all effort to be focused on the
mathematics itself.  Anyone can purge things, clean up comments, revise
theorems, and make use of it any way he or she sees fit without fear of
violating the fine print of a contract, license, or law.  Professional
courtesy demands acknowledgment where appropriate and practical, but in
my view this should be a matter of ethics and common sense rather than
law.

<P>A mathematical result per se cannot be copyrighted, only its
presentation.  The existing communication channels and peer-reviewed
journals already ensure proper credit for significant mathematical
discoveries, and journal publication establishing precedence will
usually happen well before formalization into a computer database.  If,
in the distant future, computer-verified databases become a primary
means of communication, in principle they can be registered
<!-- <SUP>*</SUP> -->
with a trusted authority to establish precedence and still be placed in
the public domain.  Public domain ensures that others are unencumbered to
freely build on the work and maximize the rate of progress in the field.
This is what already happens informally now.  In present-day
mathematics, falsely claiming credit for someone else's discovery is an
ethical violation that is rarely pursued legally; instead, the
punishment that effectively results from a tarnished reputation is
already a severe one.

<P><A NAME="qed"></A>The founders of the <A
HREF="http://mizar.org/qed/">QED Project</A> [accessed 17-Aug-2018] also
considered public domain important for its purposes.  The goal of this
project is to build a comprehensive repository of computer-verified
mathematics.  From the <A
HREF="http://www.rbjones.com/rbjpub/logic/qedres02.htm">QED
Manifesto</A> [accessed 17-Aug-2018]:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  Objection 2:  Intellectual property problems.  Such an enterprise as QED
  is doomed because as soon as it is even slightly successful, it will be
  so swamped by lawyers with issues of ownership, copyright, trade
  secrecy, and patent law that the necessary wide cooperation of hundreds
  of mathematicians, computer scientists, research agencies, and
  institutions will become impossible.

  <P>Reply to Objection 2:  In full cognizance of the dangers of this
  objection, we put forward as a fundamental and initial principle that
  the entirety of the QED system is to be in the international public
  domain, so that all can freely benefit from it, and thus be inspired to
  contribute to its further development.
